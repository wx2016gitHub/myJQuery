This demo application is to verify basic JQuery functionality. 
I used a simple Bank system to demo my jQuery program. 
I used a pre-definition Jason array in memory as the data should be from a Database system. 
The ID field is only 11, 22, 33, 44, and 55 available for this demo application. 
There are other demos that also can demonstrate my jQuery skill. 
This demo program needs to connect network for using jQuery and bootstrap library.

click file mainPage.html to run the demo application.
